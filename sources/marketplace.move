    # sui move 2024 marketplace module

    > NOTE: sui version >= 1.22.0 and the edition = " 2024.beta ".

    - This module is a marketplace where users can create shops and sell items. 
    - Every shop is a global shared object that is managed by the shop owner, which is designated by the ownership of the shop owner capability. 
    - The shop owner can add items to their shop, unlist items, and withdraw the profit from their shop. 
    - Users can purchase items from shops and will receive a purchased item receipt for each item purchased.

    ## Structs

    ### (1) Shops 
        - A Shop is a global shared object that is managed by the shop owner. 
        - The shop object holds items and the balance of SUI coins in the shop. 
    
    ### (2) Shop ownership:
        - Ownership of the Shop object is represented by holding the shop owner capability object.  
        - The shop owner has the ability to add items to the shop, unlist items, and withdraw from the shop. 

    ## Functions
    ### (1) create_shop: Create a shop
        Creates a new shop for the recipient and emits a ShopCreated event.


    ### (2) add_item: Adding items to a shop: 
        The shop owner can add items to their shop with the add_item function.

    ### (3) purchase_item: Purchasing an item
        Anyone has the ability to purchase an item that is listed. 
        When an item is purchased, the buyer will receive a separate purchased item receipt for each item purchased. 
        The purchased item receipt is a object that is owned by the buyer and is used to represent a purchased item.

    ### (4) unlist_item: Unlisting an item
        The shop owner can unlist an item from their shop with the unlist_item function. 
        When an item is unlisted, it will no longer be available for purchase.

    ### (5) withdraw_from_shop: Withdrawing from a shop: 
        The shop owner can withdraw SUI from their shop with the withdraw_from_shop function. The shop 
        owner can withdraw any amount from their shop that is equal to or below the total amount in 
        the shop. The amount withdrawn will be sent to the recipient address specified.
